# Introduction

This project is in progress and inspirated by [jsperanto](https://github.com/jpjoyal/jsperanto).

Project goal is to provide a easy way to translate a website on clientside:

- fetch resources from server
- fetch each resource file individual (static) or all once via dynamicRoute
- apply transation to html tags with attribute _data-i18n_
- post missing key-value pairs to server (for easy development -> just add missing key on serverside)
- search for key _en-US_ first, than in _en_, than in fallback language (or de-DE, de , fallback)

# Usage

	// given merged loaded dictionaries
	{
	  "en_US": {
	    "ns.special": {
	      "app": {
	        "name": "i18n"
	      }
	    },
	    "ns.common": {}
	  },
	  "en": {
	    "ns.special": {
	      "app": {
	        "area": "Area 51"
	      }
	    },
	    "ns.common": {}
	  },
	  "dev": {
	    "ns.common": {
	      "app": {
	        "company": {
	          "name": "my company"
	        }
	      },
	      "add": "add"
	    },
	    "ns.special": {}
	  }
	}

	$.i18n.init({
	    lng: 'en_US',
	    ns: { namespaces: ['ns.common', 'ns.special'], defaultNs: 'ns.special'}
	}, function() {
	    $.t('app.name'); // -> i18n (from en-US resourcefile)
	    $.t('app.area'); // -> Area 51 (from en resourcefile)
	    $.t('ns.common:app.company.name'); // -> my company (from dev resourcefile)
	    $.t('ns.common:add'); // -> add (from dev resourcefile)
	});
