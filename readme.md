# i18next

i18next is a very popular internationalization framework for browser or any other javascript environment (eg. node.js).

The current v2 release is a big milestone in keeping continuity for your translation projects by keeping a stable, modern API started in 2011.

- [Translation Functionality](http://i18next.github.io/i18next.com/translate/)
- [API](http://i18next.github.io/i18next.com/docs/api/)
- [Migration Guide from v1.11.x](http://i18next.github.io/i18next.com/docs/migration/)


Our focus is providing the core to building a booming ecosystem. Independent of the building blocks you choose, be it react, angular or even good old jquery proper translation capabilities are just one [step away](http://i18next.github.io/i18next.com/docs/ecosystem/#frameworks).
